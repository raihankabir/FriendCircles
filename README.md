# FriendCircles
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature, i.e., if A is friend of B and B is friend of C, then A is also friend of C. A friend circle is a group of students who are directly or indirectly friends.  You are given a N×N − matrix M which consists of characters Y or N. If M[i][j]=Y, then ith and jth students are friends with each other, otherwise not. You have to print the total number of friend circles in the class.  Each element of matrix friends will be Y or N. Number of rows and columns will be equal in the matrix.  M[i][i]=Y, where 0≤i&lt;N0≤i&lt;N M[i][j] = M[j][i], where 0≤i&lt;j&lt;N
